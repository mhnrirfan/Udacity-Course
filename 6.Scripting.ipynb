    "- The `input()` function allows you to get raw input from the user.  \n",
    "- You can provide a prompt message inside the function to guide the user.  \n",
    "- The value returned by `input()` is always a string.  \n",
    "- If you need the input as a different data type, such as an integer or float, you must convert it using type casting functions like `int()` or `float()`.  \n",
    "- To evaluate the input as a Python expression, you can use the `eval()` function, which processes the input string as Python code and returns the result.  \n",
    "- Use `eval()` with caution, as it can run arbitrary and potentially unsafe code when used with untrusted input."
